# EXPOLATORY-DATA-ANALYSIS-PROJECTS.
Exploratory data analysis using Python to uncover insights and patterns.
# PROJECT OVERVIEW
This project focuses on performing exploratory data analysis to understand patterns,
relationships, and key insights within the dataset.
## Objectives
- Understand data structure and quality
- Identify trends and outliers
- Visualize key relationships
- Generate actionable insights
## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook
## KEY INSIGHTS
  ## Insight 1: CORRELATION
- Strong positive correlation between Successful Attacks and Points scored highlights the importance of offensive skills.
- Blocks positively correlate with team wins, showing defensive impact.
- Errors negatively affect points, emphasizing the need for consistency.
- Serve success moderately contributes to overall scoring.
- Age has little correlation with scoring, suggesting performance is skill-based rather than age-dependent.
  ## Insight 2: Average Attack Performance by Country
- France leads in average attacks, highlighting strong offensive capabilities.
- Iran and USA with lower average attacks may need targeted offensive training.
- Overall, attack efficiency is a key differentiator among countries in the league.
  
  ## Insight 3: Total Attacks and Blocks per Country
- Italy and France lead in both attacks and blocks, demonstrating strong all-around play.
- Japan shows a very high attack count but lower blocks, indicating an offense-heavy strategy.
- Argentina combines solid attack and defensive blocks, making them balanced competitors.
- Canada and Germany show lower totals, suggesting room for improvement in both offense and defense.
- Strong attacks paired with weak defense may create vulnerability against balanced teams.
## Insight 4:Average Serve Performance by Age 
- Players aged 20–21 and 31 have the highest serve success, showing a combination of youthful energy and experience.
- Mid-20s and mid-30s players perform moderately, maintaining consistency.
- Youngest and oldest players (19, 34–41) show lower serve efficiency, highlighting areas for improvement.
- Targeted training for these age groups could improve overall team serving performance.
